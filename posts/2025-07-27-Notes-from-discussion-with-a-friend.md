Possible project ideas:


1. Recommendations using XGBoost
2. Delivery time predictions for ecommerce delivery partner - using XGBoost?
3. Companies like then (connection b/w ecomm & delivery partner) - 
    - They don't require people who are just super expert in ML
    - They are not doing any cutting edge research
    - They look for people having good software engineering skills - coupled with decent understanding of ML
    - People from Google have such kind of skill combo
4. Time series data for prediction / recommendation using XGBoost
