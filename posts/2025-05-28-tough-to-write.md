Why I loose urge to write, almost everytime.

I have been thinking a lot, about writing of any topic that comes into my mind for a quick few paras. But I just end up adding those ideas as backlogs to my mind or note app.
On thinking more about it, why I push the urge to write for "later", and then ending up to dump the idea altogether, here are the findings:

- When the urge occurs, it says that I can surely write a lot about it. Because it feels like I have a lot of things of say about the topic.
- Also the thought that I can write a lot on a matter, makes me think that I will have to think a lot now to just write the first draft, than re-read all to ensure I sound intelligent.
- That all sounds a big task, so I ditch it at the moment and end up loosing the urge altogether.

So,

I think here is the plan:

- Just pick up the keyboard or a piece of paper, and write the thoughts as crisp and short as possible.
- Start it with just being a couple of sentences maybe.
- If I feel good doing so, maybe stretch it in the second sitting.
