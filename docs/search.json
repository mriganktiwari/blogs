    "text": "Well, it’s high time I document my current feelings and thoughts.\nLately my mind has been juggling several to-dos’. I see myself as someone who has good taste about a lot of things (which obviously can be debated upon), but I have never gone more than a couple of steps further from thinking about doing something. Few examples of things I’ve been thinking about regularly engaging myself with are: reading & writing regularly, meditating as per the technique from Naval, getting super fast with typing, coding basics of Python, guitar basics, blogging, YouTube, and above all achieving a fit and young body.\nSince I last wrote about my running transformation, I finished 200 kilometres in month of March 2020. Within a couple of weeks of achieving this personal best run record I did end up hurting my lower back. And ever since, which now have been painful 8 months, I have lived with excruciating pain and stiffness in lower back. These times have shown me getting pissed off on very silly things which I feel were part contributed by this “back” trouble. Of course there were times I experienced depression feelings, making me think hard on the how my future is going to be, to what lengths am I going to miss out on the fun of life. After my ignorance and utter wastage of many months, I did join a physiotherapy session for 2 weeks now.\nSo for past 2 weeks, my daily sessions at physio constitutes of 30 minutes of core strengthening and balancing exercises, 8 minutes of Laser/ultrasound, IFT, and heat therapies each. These weeks have brought to me a sense of strength in the lower back, and although not more than 20% recovered, I sense that I am on right track. These sessions have also introduced me to a great world of strength training using resistance bands (about which I plan on writing and recording in more detail as soon as I am ready to do so). I plan on improving my muscle strength, maintain body weight, and optimal flexibility so as to attain same agility and power I had in earlier of my life. Feeling is, that there are high chances of becoming even better than I have ever been physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, socially."

    "text": "Let me admit, today’s date looks great 20-02-2020, although its not Palindrome, which was on 02-02-2020. Amazing isn’t it, two great looking date in same month.\n“I have never been a long distance runner, till 30 January 2020”, let me explain the statement. I have spent my school days playing all kind of sports ranging from Cricket, football to volleyball, basketball. So I have an assumption of my physique of someone as athletic. Although never had a very mascular physique like “athletes”. I passed out 12th standard in 2006 and never regularly engaged in sports or physical activities, except once in a while. Untill 2012, when my weight shot up to 80kg which is slight overweight for my height of 5’10”. This was the period when I started working and sunk into a comfortable lifestyle with friends and did not worry about health.\nThis period of weight gain brought me back to senses that I should do something about it, although all I did was running in teadmill for maximum 2 kilometers daily along with some stretching and abs workouts. Doing this for approximately 2 months I saw drastic weight loss of 7-8 kgs, which again threw me to my confortable zone and the cycle of workouts broke from 6-8 months, leading to weight gain again. Al this cycle continued for 2 more years, where I lost some pounds 3-4 times leading back myself to sedintary lifestyle and gaining back same weight. All this while the maximum I could run was 2 kms with humungous effort, most of which were on treadmills.\nI moved up a bit to 3-3.5 kms range last year while working in San Antonio, where I fell in love with trail running (Leon Creek trail). I reached my peak of putting 70 kms in month of May 2019 where most of the runs would touch at least 3 kms. Soon I moved back to India and with hell lot of happening in life I lost that running touch until January 2020.\nAlthough I restarted with my runs in October last year, they were highly sporadic and went a maximum of 2.5 kms. It wasn’t until 30th January, it was surely a magical day in the way I felt. Because I wasn’t thinking a lot about my speed and taking some brisk walk break during the run, there arose the power, will, excitement that I can push myself. I put 5.5 kms on my Strava that day, had run for this distance a couple of times in past, this was the very first time I was feeling comfortable and enjoying a run. This day gave me a unimaginable confidence that I have something and can push my self further. Since this day, I have run for 14 times in February 2020, 90 percent of these runs being 4-5 kms. Today, again I had some magical power and was feeling good enough to extend my long runs record to 10 kms. There was a certain confidence, confort while doing so.\n\n\n\nSnapshot of today’s run stats\n\n\nI know I have talked about this drastic progress in tems of being magical, but as we all know there is no magic, I must admit that most of the credit goes to my improved diet (this is my assumption for now, would update in future as more discoveries arise). Undoubtedly, getting into a diet of greens, fruits, fresh cooked food (entire credit goes to my wife) had transformative change in my runs. My shins feel less breaking, even though I start with tight calves, they soon recover"

    "text": "Some background\nSince I last mentioned about my back injury in this blog, it’s been well over 5 years now, and they just flew by. In that period I’ve become a father to a daughter who just might be sweetest in the world, totaly failed at managing / healing my injury, got to a point physically that was my worst - fat and depressed, thought that am not built to do jobs and quit without having any side hustle or backup plan. It’s been an year since I quit the job, and wonder where that year went. Anyways, here I am at this juncture that urgency has hit back once more in my life and I must get an “unhealthy obsession” kinda routine to make me stand out in at least one direction, even if it’s getting back to a job.\n\n\nWhere I stand now\nI want to work at a very good tech company, likes of Google, Meta which would give me some validation and self satisfaction. Going to an mediocre company might be plausible at the current situation, but I strongly don’t want to get stuck there. But from what I perceive now, it’s impossible to get my profile pass the resume shortlisting at top companies, unless there is a aggressive hiring and HRs are reaching out themselves. But in that case I might easily get thrown out in initial couple of interviews.\n\n\nMaking myself stand out\nSo here is my plan to stand out so that recruiters or professionals appreciate the work I generate and recommend it towards good roles. No more working in the silo of following some training and writing a bunch of codes, having those bullshit repos on my laptop or maybe a private githup repo. I want to explain things in my blogs, expose myself to the world of vlogging while learning new stuff and in general growing. Also I think I can teach not just tech, but also handling back pain to some extent, although not in medical terms.\n\nWhat will I blog about:\n\nBasic steps of doing Exploratory Data Analysis\nHandling issues with structured data\nRegression algorithms - from scratch, and using libraries\nClassification algorithms - from scratch, and using libraries\nClustering algoritms - from scratch, and using libraries\n[Grow the list]\n\n\n\nWhat will I make videos about:\n\nRe-building back, what makes seating so painful for someone who already has a back problem\nFat loss, why can it be so easy\nStarting CALISTHENICS\nAbout coding algorithms from scratch\n\n\n\nSteps of execution:\n\nInitially I plan to post a blog every alternate day at least, at least uptil the topics are relatively trivial\nMaybe 2 videos every week, this is a tough one to target maybe.\n\nI want to post and update to this blog in a month time, to document my journey. My back is against a wall, so f*** it, let’s do it.\nCheers!"

    "text": "As mush as I cherish getting this opportunity, there have been bitter and sweet memories during these 3 years. A novel though that just flew by at 4:24 AM made me to sit and take some quick notes.\nMy Nanaji passed away on Nov 10th, 2016 so it’s been 3+ years to that and I understood life doesn’t stop. My mother passed away on June 6th 2019 and it’s been 6 months to that already, again, life doesn’t stop. I pledge to myself today while remembering them both, I will tirelessly work for my development here onwards.\nHere are some learnings I had while studying, working in the US and again back to India.\n\nFriendships are hard to come by - In these 3 years I came across many people, only one became long term friend who is to stay.\nRegret of not being to spend time with loved ones is killing - I would add it to top in the life goals list. No matter how adventurous things I achieve in life, I’ll regret not fulfilling this one.\nI would again love to do it, go out in the unknown territory, explore the world and build a new life - only this time with lot informed decisions.\nIt’s always worth taking risks, especially the one where you’re uncertain of the end result. There is no fun in embarking of a journey if you’re familiar with its entirety.\nIn my thoughts I have always been true to myself. But have not done much to work on my shortcomings. I want to do well in Machine Learning field but haven’t been practicing much. I lack heavily on hands on experience, okay, here’s the truth in blunt words. I’ve got my first job in N-Join without much hands on, then got another with Ai Reverie based on recommendation from N-Join (again very less hands on or useful work), the worked for Fractal analytics on completely out of my interest SQL work (although I learned many other things here). Now I am working for Samsung R&D India (supposedly on DL) but again it’s just floating on the water. There is no deep dive, am doing nothing for my development in this perspective.\n\nSo I COMMIT today to work hard on this front of my life. Additionally, things I want to explore and excel into are: - Kaggle competitions - Upload my work to Github - Video creation of my work, things I love (maybe Vlog, blog etc.) - Get back to SPORTS, be fully fit throughout 2020 and achieve best physical shape - Read for 30 mins before sleeping. Complete 124 books in 2020."
