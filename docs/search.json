    "text": "Why I loose urge to write, almost everytime.\nI have been thinking a lot, about writing of any topic that comes into my mind for a quick few paras. But I just end up adding those ideas as backlogs to my mind or note app. On thinking more about it, why I push the urge to write for “later”, and then ending up to dump the idea altogether, here are the findings:\n\nWhen the urge occurs, it says that I can surely write a lot about it. Because it feels like I have a lot of things of say about the topic.\nAlso the thought that I can write a lot on a matter, makes me think that I will have to think a lot now to just write the first draft, than re-read all to ensure I sound intelligent.\nThat all sounds a big task, so I ditch it at the moment and end up loosing the urge altogether.\n\n\nSo,\nI think here is the plan:\n\nJust pick up the keyboard or a piece of paper, and write the thoughts as crisp and short as possible.\nStart it with just being a couple of sentences maybe.\nIf I feel good doing so, maybe stretch it in the second sitting."

    "text": "Well, it’s high time I document my current feelings and thoughts.\nLately my mind has been juggling several to-dos’. I see myself as someone who has good taste about a lot of things (which obviously can be debated upon), but I have never gone more than a couple of steps further from thinking about doing something. Few examples of things I’ve been thinking about regularly engaging myself with are: reading & writing regularly, meditating as per the technique from Naval, getting super fast with typing, coding basics of Python, guitar basics, blogging, YouTube, and above all achieving a fit and young body.\nSince I last wrote about my running transformation, I finished 200 kilometres in month of March 2020. Within a couple of weeks of achieving this personal best run record I did end up hurting my lower back. And ever since, which now have been painful 8 months, I have lived with excruciating pain and stiffness in lower back. These times have shown me getting pissed off on very silly things which I feel were part contributed by this “back” trouble. Of course there were times I experienced depression feelings, making me think hard on the how my future is going to be, to what lengths am I going to miss out on the fun of life. After my ignorance and utter wastage of many months, I did join a physiotherapy session for 2 weeks now.\nSo for past 2 weeks, my daily sessions at physio constitutes of 30 minutes of core strengthening and balancing exercises, 8 minutes of Laser/ultrasound, IFT, and heat therapies each. These weeks have brought to me a sense of strength in the lower back, and although not more than 20% recovered, I sense that I am on right track. These sessions have also introduced me to a great world of strength training using resistance bands (about which I plan on writing and recording in more detail as soon as I am ready to do so). I plan on improving my muscle strength, maintain body weight, and optimal flexibility so as to attain same agility and power I had in earlier of my life. Feeling is, that there are high chances of becoming even better than I have ever been physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, socially."

    "text": "As mush as I cherish getting this opportunity, there have been bitter and sweet memories during these 3 years. A novel though that just flew by at 4:24 AM made me to sit and take some quick notes.\nMy Nanaji passed away on Nov 10th, 2016 so it’s been 3+ years to that and I understood life doesn’t stop. My mother passed away on June 6th 2019 and it’s been 6 months to that already, again, life doesn’t stop. I pledge to myself today while remembering them both, I will tirelessly work for my development here onwards.\nHere are some learnings I had while studying, working in the US and again back to India.\n\nFriendships are hard to come by - In these 3 years I came across many people, only one became long term friend who is to stay.\nRegret of not being to spend time with loved ones is killing - I would add it to top in the life goals list. No matter how adventurous things I achieve in life, I’ll regret not fulfilling this one.\nI would again love to do it, go out in the unknown territory, explore the world and build a new life - only this time with lot informed decisions.\nIt’s always worth taking risks, especially the one where you’re uncertain of the end result. There is no fun in embarking of a journey if you’re familiar with its entirety.\nIn my thoughts I have always been true to myself. But have not done much to work on my shortcomings. I want to do well in Machine Learning field but haven’t been practicing much. I lack heavily on hands on experience, okay, here’s the truth in blunt words. I’ve got my first job in N-Join without much hands on, then got another with Ai Reverie based on recommendation from N-Join (again very less hands on or useful work), the worked for Fractal analytics on completely out of my interest SQL work (although I learned many other things here). Now I am working for Samsung R&D India (supposedly on DL) but again it’s just floating on the water. There is no deep dive, am doing nothing for my development in this perspective.\n\nSo I COMMIT today to work hard on this front of my life. Additionally, things I want to explore and excel into are: - Kaggle competitions - Upload my work to Github - Video creation of my work, things I love (maybe Vlog, blog etc.) - Get back to SPORTS, be fully fit throughout 2020 and achieve best physical shape - Read for 30 mins before sleeping. Complete 124 books in 2020."

    "text": "Some background\nSince I last mentioned about my back injury in this blog, it’s been well over 5 years now, and they just flew by. In that period I’ve become a father to a daughter who just might be sweetest in the world, totaly failed at managing / healing my injury, got to a point physically that was my worst - fat and depressed, thought that am not built to do jobs and quit without having any side hustle or backup plan. It’s been an year since I quit the job, and wonder where that year went. Anyways, here I am at this juncture that urgency has hit back once more in my life and I must get an “unhealthy obsession” kinda routine to make me stand out in at least one direction, even if it’s getting back to a job.\n\n\nWhere I stand now\nI want to work at a very good tech company, likes of Google, Meta which would give me some validation and self satisfaction. Going to an mediocre company might be plausible at the current situation, but I strongly don’t want to get stuck there. But from what I perceive now, it’s impossible to get my profile pass the resume shortlisting at top companies, unless there is a aggressive hiring and HRs are reaching out themselves. But in that case I might easily get thrown out in initial couple of interviews.\n\n\nMaking myself stand out\nSo here is my plan to stand out so that recruiters or professionals appreciate the work I generate and recommend it towards good roles. No more working in the silo of following some training and writing a bunch of codes, having those bullshit repos on my laptop or maybe a private githup repo. I want to explain things in my blogs, expose myself to the world of vlogging while learning new stuff and in general growing. Also I think I can teach not just tech, but also handling back pain to some extent, although not in medical terms.\n\nWhat will I blog about:\n\nBasic steps of doing Exploratory Data Analysis\nHandling issues with structured data\nRegression algorithms - from scratch, and using libraries\nClassification algorithms - from scratch, and using libraries\nClustering algoritms - from scratch, and using libraries\n[Grow the list]\n\n\n\nWhat will I make videos about:\n\nRe-building back, what makes seating so painful for someone who already has a back problem\nFat loss, why can it be so easy\nStarting CALISTHENICS\nAbout coding algorithms from scratch\n\n\n\nSteps of execution:\n\nInitially I plan to post a blog every alternate day at least, at least uptil the topics are relatively trivial\nMaybe 2 videos every week, this is a tough one to target maybe.\n\nI want to post and update to this blog in a month time, to document my journey. My back is against a wall, so f*** it, let’s do it.\nCheers!"

    "text": "Let me admit, today’s date looks great 20-02-2020, although its not Palindrome, which was on 02-02-2020. Amazing isn’t it, two great looking date in same month.\n“I have never been a long distance runner, till 30 January 2020”, let me explain the statement. I have spent my school days playing all kind of sports ranging from Cricket, football to volleyball, basketball. So I have an assumption of my physique of someone as athletic. Although never had a very mascular physique like “athletes”. I passed out 12th standard in 2006 and never regularly engaged in sports or physical activities, except once in a while. Untill 2012, when my weight shot up to 80kg which is slight overweight for my height of 5’10”. This was the period when I started working and sunk into a comfortable lifestyle with friends and did not worry about health.\nThis period of weight gain brought me back to senses that I should do something about it, although all I did was running in teadmill for maximum 2 kilometers daily along with some stretching and abs workouts. Doing this for approximately 2 months I saw drastic weight loss of 7-8 kgs, which again threw me to my confortable zone and the cycle of workouts broke from 6-8 months, leading to weight gain again. Al this cycle continued for 2 more years, where I lost some pounds 3-4 times leading back myself to sedintary lifestyle and gaining back same weight. All this while the maximum I could run was 2 kms with humungous effort, most of which were on treadmills.\nI moved up a bit to 3-3.5 kms range last year while working in San Antonio, where I fell in love with trail running (Leon Creek trail). I reached my peak of putting 70 kms in month of May 2019 where most of the runs would touch at least 3 kms. Soon I moved back to India and with hell lot of happening in life I lost that running touch until January 2020.\nAlthough I restarted with my runs in October last year, they were highly sporadic and went a maximum of 2.5 kms. It wasn’t until 30th January, it was surely a magical day in the way I felt. Because I wasn’t thinking a lot about my speed and taking some brisk walk break during the run, there arose the power, will, excitement that I can push myself. I put 5.5 kms on my Strava that day, had run for this distance a couple of times in past, this was the very first time I was feeling comfortable and enjoying a run. This day gave me a unimaginable confidence that I have something and can push my self further. Since this day, I have run for 14 times in February 2020, 90 percent of these runs being 4-5 kms. Today, again I had some magical power and was feeling good enough to extend my long runs record to 10 kms. There was a certain confidence, confort while doing so.\n\n\n\nSnapshot of today’s run stats\n\n\nI know I have talked about this drastic progress in tems of being magical, but as we all know there is no magic, I must admit that most of the credit goes to my improved diet (this is my assumption for now, would update in future as more discoveries arise). Undoubtedly, getting into a diet of greens, fruits, fresh cooked food (entire credit goes to my wife) had transformative change in my runs. My shins feel less breaking, even though I start with tight calves, they soon recover"

    "text": "I am on a journey to build solid fundamentals (practically at least) in AI-ML. Plan is to implement most prevalent class of algorithms from scratch. Now, in the past I’ve used most of these algorithms, almost always using some specialised libraries (say sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch). But I’ve noticed in the ML interview rounds of big tech firms they start from basics, and grill you at every step or chance they get. So I want want to get really good at doing the basics.\nIt goes like this, break down any problem statement into atomic steps. The EDA and viz, data preprocessing and transformations, understanding pros and cons of different modeling options from the perspective of the given problem, loss functions and eval scores, and lastly doing the predictions. I just want to be very handy and deft at doing these for very basic problems and the advanced ones.\nI took a simple regression problem (from Kaggle) and started working on it. Tried Linear Regression with different features, transformed targets etc., but couldn’t reach anywhere close to the eval score most were achieving in the competition. Then understood that because of heteroskedasticity in the data, these linear models would never be able to explain the variance in data (unless of course we use feature interactions to increase complexity), therefore moved onto Tree based methods, and now implementing Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and so on..\nLet me get to the point, through this process, I’ve been using chatgpt as my pair programmer. I ask for suggestions, explain my point of view and get feedback, discuss with it how i plan to implement methodically. Earlier when I would have tried to embark on such a journey, at any hurdle I would need to resort to some stackoverflow posts, blogs, YouTube videos, which would easily derail me from the flow. Or I shall say I never was able to continue being interested in such attempts.\nMoreover, using chatgpt drastically saves me time in many ways:\n\nTime saved from going for unnecessary Google or YouTube search, and getting pulled into distractions instead\nIt’s way easier to get any silliest or fundamentals questions answered, right there and then, so it gets very productive to just improve and keep making connections, building up the knowledge.\nThe GEM, it has shifted my thinking that it’s way faster to understand while such specific resource, instead of watching or reading blogs that just are full of space wasting nonsense.\n\nCheers!"
