dir)","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n- `find .` | Find all the files & directories under current directory\n- `find <dir>` | Find all the files & directories under <dir>\n\n- `find <dir> -type d` | Find only directories under specific directory\n- `find . -type d` | Find only directories under current directory\n\n- `find <dir> -type f` | Find only files under specific directory\n- `find . -type f` | Find only files under current directory\n\n### Search by file name\n\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"<test1.txt>\"` | Find a file with a specific name\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"<test*>\"` | Find a file starting with the name 'test'\n- `find <dir> -type f -iname \"<test*>\"` | Find a file starting with the name 'test' or 'Test' & Case Insensitive\n- `find <dir> -type f -iname \"<*.py>\"` | Find a file ending with the name '.py' & Case Insensitive\n\n### Search by time / day\n\n- `find <dir> -type f -mmin -10` | All the files modified in last 10 mins\n- `find <dir> -type f -mmin +10` | All the files modified in more than last 10 mins ago\n- `find <dir> -type f -mmin +1 -mmin -5` | More than 1 min ago and less than 5 mins ago\n\n- `find <dir> -type f -mtime -20` | Files modified less than 20 days ago\n\n  - mmin, mtime\n  - amin, atime\n  - cmin, ctime\n\n### Search by file size\n\n- `find <dir> -size +5M` | Find all the files over 5 MB under <dir> directory\n  - M - MB\n  - k - KB\n  - G - GB\n- `ls -lah <dir>` | List all files and dirs with size in MB\n\n- `find <dir> -empty` | Find all empty files in <dir> directory\n\n### Search based on permissions\n\n- `find <dir> -perm 777`\n\n##### Change user & group for every file & dir under <dir>\n- `-exec` | Executes the following command on the results from preceding command\n- `{}` | Placeholder for just the filenamees that would be be used in case of chown command\n- `+` or `\\;` | Either can be used to end the command\n- `find <dir> -exec chown [user]:[group] {} +`\n\n##### Lets try setting permissions of all directories to 775 and all files to 664\n- `find <dir> -type d -exec chmod 775 {} +`\n- `find <dir> -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +`\n\n\n### Search and perform actions\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"*.jpg\"` | Search all image files ending in .jpg in <dir> and subsequent directories\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -maxdepth 1` | Search all image files ending in .jpg only and only in <dir>\n\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -exec rm {} +` | Deletes all the files returned from the command precesing `-exec`\n- `find <dir> -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -maxdepth 1 -exec rm {} +` | Deletes all the files returned from the command precesing `-exec`\n\n\n\n\n\n## _grep (Global Regular Expression Print)\n\n- `grep` is case sensitive\n\n### Finding is a given text is present in some file\n- `grep \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | Searching for some text in a normal file\n- `grep -w \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | Return results from `file_name` only when whole words match `text_to_find`\n- `grep -wi \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | Returns results with both lower case and upper case with `text_to_find`\n\n### Finding some additional information\n\n##### Line number of where we found our match\n\n1. *Returns results with line number.*\n  - `grep -win \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | Returns results with line numbers in `file_name`\n  - `grep -win \"text_to_find\" ./*` | Returns results with line numbers in all files in current directory + Will throw error for any subdirectory that might be present.\n  - `grep -win \"text_to_find\" ./*.txt` | Doesn't try to search in any subdirectory.\n  - `grep -winr \"text_to_find\" .` | To search every file and through every subdirectory, a recursive search, might get lot of results.\n\n2. *Getting some additional context of where this match is found, see a certain number of lines before and after a match.*\n  - `grep -win -B 4 \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | 4 lines Before all of our match\n  - `grep -win -A 4 \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | 4 lines After all of our match\n  - `grep -win -C 2 \"text_to_find\" <file_name>` | 2 lines Before and After all of our match\n\n3. *If you're only interested in file_names with the matches, NOT in the matches themselves.*\n  - `grep -wirl \"text_to_find\" .` | Recursive result of all files with the match\n  - `grep -wirc \"text_to_find\" .` | Recursive result of all files with the match + Number of matches in each file\n\n### Pipe the output of other commands in to **grep** to search for something\n- `history | grep \"git commit\"`\n- `history | grep \"git commit\" | grep \"dotfile\"`\n\n##### **grep** uses Posix regular expressions by default\n- `grep \"...-...-....\" <filename>`\n- `grep \"\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\" <filename>` | This wouldn't work, because this is pro compatible regular expressions which grep doesn't use.\n- `grep -P \"\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\" <filename>` | This would allow it to work on Linux, NOT on Mac\n- `grep -wirlP \"\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\" <filename>` | Return recursive list of list with matching phone numbers\n- `grep -V`\n  - Mac uses BSD grep\n  - Linux uses GNU grep`\n- `brew install grep --with-default-names`\n  - `--with-default-names` | It will install it as grep, else as ggrep (allowing us to use both BSD and GNU grep)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Search by Type (file or dir)\n-
