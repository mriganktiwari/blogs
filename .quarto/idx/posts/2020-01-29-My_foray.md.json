I lack heavily on hands on experience, okay, here’s the truth in blunt words. I’ve got my first job in N-Join without much hands on, then got another with Ai Reverie based on recommendation from N-Join (again very less hands on or useful work), the worked for Fractal analytics on completely out of my interest SQL work (although I learned many other things here).

There is no deep dive, am doing nothing for my development in this perspective.\n\nSo I COMMIT today to work hard on this front of my life. Additionally, things I want to explore and excel into are:\n- Kaggle competitions\n- Upload my work to Github\n- Video creation of my work, things I love (maybe Vlog, blog etc.)\n- Get back to SPORTS, be fully fit throughout 2020 and achieve best physical shape\n- Read for 30 mins before sleeping.
