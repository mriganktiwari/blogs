Within a couple of weeks of achieving this personal best run record I did end up hurting my lower back.

These times have shown me getting pissed off on very silly things which I feel were part contributed by this \"back\" trouble.

These sessions have also introduced me to a great world of strength training using resistance bands (about which I plan on writing and recording in more detail as soon as I am ready to do so). I plan on improving my muscle strength, maintain body weight, and optimal flexibility so as to attain same agility and power I had in earlier of my life. **Feeling is, that there are high chances of becoming even better than I have ever been physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, socially**.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWell, it's high time I document my current feelings and thoughts.\n\n\n\nLately my mind has been juggling several to-dos'.
